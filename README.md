## BerlinJS Framework hackathon

We try to implement https://github.com/berlinjs/framework-special-hackathon in a hackathon at #berlinjs
with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io)
and use [aframe-react](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react).

To boostrap quickly we used 
[aframe-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react-boilerplate)
as boilerplat
